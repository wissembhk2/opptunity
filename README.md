<p>In order to run this project you just need docker and docker compose :</p>
<p>you need to execute : <b>docker compose up</b> in the root folder ( opptunity/freelance) </p>
<p>in this project : - signup works ( localhost:3000/signup ) </p>
             <p>     - sigin works ( localhost:3000/signin ) ( for now i only created a prototype so is doesn't generate a token it just check the email and password ) </p>
              <p>    - signup with google or microsoft ( not implemented yet ) </p>
             <p>     -mail confirmation (not implemented yet in the backend ) you can test the front on ( loacalhost:3000/emailconfirmation ) </p>
              <p>    - you can check add details page via ( localhost:3000/adddetails ) ( front implemented ) </p>

<p>-This project is only for testing purposes in order to use it in prod env you must hide you credentials in an .env file or use Vault </p>
<p>-you must also generate a token in the signin </p>
<p>-you must create routers files in the backend and avoid routing in main.py </p>

<p> Ps : a lot of changes can be applied on this task but due to time limits I can't do it perfectly </p>
